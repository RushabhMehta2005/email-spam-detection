Model: Random Forest Classifier
Version: 1.0
Date: 25-06-2024

Dataset: Email Spam Detection Dataset
Source: https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/
Preprocessing:
    - Feature Extraction
    - Word Stemming for improved model intelligence

Evaluation Metrics:
    - Best Model Precision: 0.83 
    - for non-spam emails:
        Precision (Class 0): 0.92
        Recall (Class 0): 0.94
        F1-score (Class 0): 0.93
    - for spam emails:
        Precision (Class 1): 0.87
        Recall (Class 1): 0.83
        F1-score (Class 1): 0.85

Additional Notes:
- The model performed well on the test set with an precision of 83% and 
  good F1-scores (> 0.85) for both the classes.
- Class imbalance was addressed using a lower decision threshold, improving recall for Class 1 (spam).
- Further tuning of hyperparameters could potentially improve overall performance.
